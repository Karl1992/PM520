## Question

For fixed area A, is the expected distance between two randomly chosen points, E(d), bigger for a square or a rectangle?

## Solution
For this question, we can randomly select one side of rectangle with area A and do this multiple times.

```{r}
# Several global variable
A <- 100
a <- sqrt(A) # calcualte side of a square
distanceamount<-10000 # amount of distance between two points in a rectangle or square
amountofrectangular<-100 # amount of different rectangles in this trial

# calcualte the distance
distance<-function(c1,c2){
  m <- rbind(c1,c2)
  return(dist(m))
  
}

# define some vectors
r <- numeric() # distances in a rectangular
s <- numeric() # distances in a square
avr <- numeric() # different E(d)s
judge <- numeric() # judge if E(d) is bigger than D

# Calculate D
for( i in 1:distanceamount){
    s1 <- runif(2,0,a)
    s2 <- runif(2,0,a)
    s[i] <- distance(s1,s2)
}
avs <- mean(s)

# Start the trial
for( i in 1:amountofrectangular){
  for(j in 1:distanceamount){
    ra <- runif(1,0,100)
    rb <- 100/ra
    r1 <- c(runif(1,0,ra),runif(1,0,rb))
    r2 <- c(runif(1,0,ra),runif(1,0,rb))
    r[j] <- distance(r1,r2)
    s[j] <- distance(s1,s2)  
  }
  avr[i] <- mean(r)
  judge[i] <- avr[i]>avs
}

count <- sum(judge)
p <- count/amountofrectangular

cat("\nSo our p-value is: ",p)
```

## Conclusion
The trial was repeated with 100 different rectangles. 

The result is that E(d) is always bigger than D with a p-value of 1.
